                        <p>The cookies used within Nagwa Services can be broadly divided into the following categories:</p>
                        
                        <ol>

                                <p>These cookies are essential for us to provide users with our Services. 
                                    They enable users to navigate our websites and apps, and access secure areas. Without them, we cannot provide our Services. Because of this, we do not need to ask for consent to use them.</p></li>
                            
                            <li><i>Performance Cookies</i><br>
                            
                                <p>These cookies track how users navigate and use our Services. For example, they can be used to track which of our web pages visitors go to most often, whether users opened marketing emails from us, and more.</p>
                            
                                <p>This information is not linked to any individual users, and instead allows us to collectively categorize our users into different groups so we can understand the relative proportions within each of these groups.</p>
                                
                                <p>We do not pass this information to third parties in a way that allows users to be personally identified. However, we may associate this cookie data with other personally identifiable data submitted by 
                                    our users (e.g. when they partially or fully complete a form), in order to ensure our communications are relevant to our users. We ask each user’s consent to use these cookies.</p>

                                <p>We use certain cookies to collect information about the usage of our Services. We use this information to improve the user experience by prioritizing improvements to be made to our Services, 
                                    as well as figuring out which parts of our Services are most used in order to provide a better user experience.</p>
                                
                                <p>The emails we send out to users for marketing purposes may contain a “web beacon pixel” used to determine whether an email was opened, and to verify any clicks on links or advertisements within the email.</p>
                                
                                <p>We may use this information to determine which emails are of more interest to users, and to ask users who do not open our emails if they wish to continue receiving them.</p>
                                
                                <p>When an email is deleted, the web beacon pixel is also deleted. If a user does not wish for the pixel to be downloaded onto their device, 
                                    they should read the email in plain text view, with images disabled. We ask each user’s consent to use these cookies.</p>
